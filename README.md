MarkerPolygon
=============

MarkerPolygon is an editable polygon component developed to the <a href="https://developer.here.com/frontpage">HereMaps Javascript API</a>. 

It is based on the editable and draggable shapes available on the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/shapes#user-editable">GoogleMaps API</a>, which has intermediate vertexes where the user can click and drag it to customize its shape the way it wants.

This component uses <code>canvas</code> to make the drag movement smoother when compared to others code examples available in the Here documentation.

<ul>
	<li>HereMaps Javascript API v2.5</li>
	<li>jQuery v1.7</li>
