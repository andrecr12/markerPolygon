MarkerPolygon
=============

MarkerPolygon is an editable polygon component developed to the <a href="https://developer.here.com/frontpage">HereMaps Javascript API</a>. 

It is based on the editable and draggable shapes available on the GoogleMaps API (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/shapes#user-editable), which has intermediate vertexes where the user can click and drag it in order to customize its shape the way he/she wants.

This component uses <code>canvas</code> to make the drag movement smoother when compared to others code examples available in the Here documentation.


Dependencies:
	- HereMaps Javascript API v2.5
	- jQuery v1.7


To-Do:
	- Include here more information about how to initialize it, available arguments and methods;
	- Provide a live demo;
	- Improve its encapsulation by using self involking anonymous function;
	- Expand it to work with new HereMaps API v3.0;
	- Include a minimized version of the code;
	- Remove jQuery dependency;

	- Lots of other important things.. (this is just the beginning :D)
